          <p>

            their cornerstone model with a newly designed cutaway body shape. Famous Vintage Sunburst finish.
            The iconic finish, each hand sprayed for an authentic Gibson Acoustic look. The new J-45 Cutaway
            is spec’d just like the J-45 Standard. Including Nickel Grover tuners, black 1.725” nut, Tusq saddle,
            mahogany back and sides, plus the famous Gibson Vintage Sunburst finish. For the 2017 model features

          <h2>Mellowing Out</h2>
          <p>
            This addition to the collection was actually driven by Mike's wife. Tired of hearing him blast through
            Metallica and Megadeth nonstop, she encouraged him to get a guitar that would be complementory to some
            less frantic music. Another great thing about this guitar is that is can be plugged in electrically; something
            that will definitely come in hand for shows at Kellogg this year!

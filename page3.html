          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            The Fender American Professional Stratocaster solidbody electric guitar has been
            crafted to give you the best design elements from classic vintage Strats and the most
            popular modern features in one gig-ready instrument. Tim Shaw designed the three V-mod
            single-coil pickups for a vintage voice that is balanced across all the switch positions.
            Fender's popular neck carve has been enhanced to a Deep-C profile that fits your hand comfortably.
            The Fender American Professional Stratocaster has all the elements that make Fender guitars legendary, and much more.

          <h2>Versatility</h2>
          <p>
            The wonderful thing about a strat is its versatility. You can get so many different sounds with this thing,
            and the feel is just unbeatable. The axe is so perfectly contoured to fit a human body that it is a wonder how
            right they got this thing when it was originally designed in the 50s. This is Mike's primary gigging guitar,
            as there is just no beating the sound quality and comfortability.
